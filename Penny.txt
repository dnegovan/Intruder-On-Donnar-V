Hey, Captain!  How are things?
Harper is a sweetheart, but I wish he wouldn’t get so headstrong when we’re in the thick of it, it’s not productive when the two of you argue.
Holly makes the best cupcakes! Plus it’s nice having another woman on board.
Oh, Nate.  If I’ve gone a day without rolling my eyes at his ridiculousness, I don’t remember it.
Lester has the most analytical mind of anyone I’ve met.  He looks at you over his glasses and it feels like he’s got you completely figured out.
