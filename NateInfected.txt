Hey, Captain. What's going on?
Harper is an amazing pilot. I can definitely see why he graduated at the top of his class.
Holly’s mastery of the Blarktak language is impressive.
The best doctor you could ask for.  And her knowledge of unique biological processes is so valuable on our missions.
Lester is the only man I’d trust with the ship’s engine. Not many engineers have experience with both GR series and KHM class fusion generators.
