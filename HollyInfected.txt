Hi Honey, what's up?
Harper is such an amazing pilot! I can definitely see why he graduated at the top of his class. We’re lucky to have him.
The best doctor you could ask for.  And her knowledge of unique biological processes is so valuable on our missions!
Nate knows this ship’s systems so well, I think he could keep them running in his sleep.
Lester is the only one I’d ever trust with the ship’s engine. Not many engineers have experience with both GR series and KHM class fusion generators.
