Hey, Captain!  What can I do for you?
Love having Holly on board, her red hair reminds me of my daughter back home.
Penny is the best.  Everyone on this crew is intelligent but sheâ€™s really a genius.  I remember she let me borrow a book on Ektresian fauna that was so dense I could barely understand it.
Nate kind of acts like a jackass but I just try to remember he saved my life that one time on JM-356.  Plus I can always beat him at cards which brings him down a peg or two.
Lester is like the Dad I never had.  Love that guy.
