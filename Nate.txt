Hey, Cap. What's going on?
Harper is a god damned cheater, I swear I’ll catch him with a card up his sleeve one of these days.
Holly is great, and the two of you are perfect together.  I’m really glad that the date we went on forever ago never went anywhere, and that the two of you got together instead.
I wish I could act like myself around her!  I feel like I have to act macho or something to impress her and I can tell she hates it.  Maybe I should tell her that.
I call him “Old Man”  but I think he’s only a few years older than I am!   Just a hell of a guy, more integrity in his finger than most of the guys we knew at the Academy.
