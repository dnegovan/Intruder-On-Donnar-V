Your crew has just returned from a brief exploration of planet UB-8756.  Someone aboard is carrying an alien parasite, and their mind is under its control.

You have 3 HOURS to neutralize the parasite before the host is incurable and the parasite is able to spread to other crew members.  Find out who is infected by speaking with the crew.  Prepare the neutralization compound by collecting the appropriate materials, then combining them in the LAB.  Be careful, applying the compound to the wrong person will kill them.  If you can't neutralize the parasite before incubation, you will be forced to kill any infected crew members.
