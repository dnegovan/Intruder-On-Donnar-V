MESSAGE RECEIVED ON EMERGENCY CHANNEL:

URGENT.  DO NOT LAND ON, EMBARK UPON, OR OTHERWISE CONTACT PLANET UB-8756.  There is a parasitic alien life form on the surface that can control the mind of its host. My crew is lost.

It started with one member of the crew - once we realized he wasnâ€™t himself we quarantined him and began fashioning a method to neutralize the parasite.

The compound was administered, and we believed we had killed it, but we were too late. After 12 hours the life form had incubated to a point where the compound was ineffective.

I later discovered that this was also the point where the parasite was strong enough to spread to additional hosts.

It spread to the rest of my crew before I realized my error.  Speaking with them, it became apparent that the parasite's access to the host's memories is limited.

I was forced to murder them all.

The formula for the Neutralization Compound is at the end of this transmission.  If it has been less than 12 hours from first contact with the planet, inject this compound into the host IMMEDIATELY.

DANGER: THIS COMPOUND IS DEADLY TO ANYONE NOT INFECTED.  INJECT INTO AFFLICTED SUBJECTS ONLY.  If it has been 12 hours since contact, any infected must be killed, and the bodies ejected into space for good measure.

Godspeed.
