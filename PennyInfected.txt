Hey, Captain!  How are things?
Harper is such an amazing pilot. I can definitely see why he graduated at the top of his class. We’re lucky to have him.
Holly’s mastery of the Blarktak language is impressive!
Nate knows this ship’s systems so well, I think he could keep them running in his sleep.
Lester is the only man I’d trust with the ship’s engine. Not many engineers have experience with both GR series and KHM class fusion generators.
